## Phase 1 - Freight Tool

### Goal

Get enough active usage of the tool by forwarders to launch a compelling
marketplace.

At least 10 shipments / month on top 100 tradelanes for both Air and Ocean
freight.

### Strategy

**Discover** pain points through direct contact with forwarders:

* Cold calls interviewing 1,000+ forwarders
* Bulk emails with surveys
* Bulk emails promoting tool and asking for feedback
* Site visits

**Build** features that alleviate pain points and provide value:

* Create/print bills of lading (assumption)
* Create/print invoices (assumption)
* Summarize operational/financial information (assumption)
* Tracking link for customers (assumption)
* Manage customer relationship (assumption)

## Phase 2 - Marketplace
